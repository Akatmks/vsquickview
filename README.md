## vsquickview

vsquickview is a single-frame VapourSynth preview script designed to be used together with Jupyter Notebook with these advantages compared to other tools:  
– Less waiting. vsquickview will run in a separate thread in the background, everytimes you have made an adjustment, you can immediately switch to the window to see the updated result.  
– Easier comparing and blind comparing two clips with a interface similar to slow.pics.
